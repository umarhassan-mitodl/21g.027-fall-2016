## Writing and Speaking Assignments for a Communication Intensive Course

Communication intensive subjects in the humanities, arts, and social sciences require at least 20 pages of writing divided among a number of assignments, at least one of which is revised and resubmitted. This class requires three papers and one final project that total at least 21 pages in length (double-spaced). The first essay will be graded and returned to you for your revision and resubmission. This resubmission will receive a grade separate from the grade on the first draft. The resubmission grade will be based on the extent and quality of the revision (e.g., A B paper that is poorly revised may receive a C for the resubmission).

HASS-CI subjects also offer students substantial opportunity for oral expression, through class discussion and student presentations. This class requires all students to participate in a weekly discussion of the assigned reading and films. In addition, each student will make two formal presentations, both of which will receive written feedback and be graded. The first presentation will be on your second essay, and the second presentation on your final essay. To guarantee sufficient attention to student writing and substantial opportunity for oral expression, the number of students in this class is limited to 25 with the writing advisor.

Assignment 1: Variety in Japanese perspective, lack of variety in U.S. perspective \[2 pages\]

Assignment 2: Images of Imperial Democracy \[5 pages + revision\]

Assignment 3: Selling Shiseido \[4 pages + oral presentation\]

Final Project \[10 pages + oral presentation\]
