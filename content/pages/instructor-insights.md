## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21G.027 Asia in the Modern World: Images and Representations_ as it was taught by Professor Shigeru Miyagawa in Fall 2016.

This course explored images that pertain to the emergence of Japan as a modern state. It focused on images that depict Japan as it came into contact with the rest of the world after its long and deep isolation during the feudal period.

A unique feature of this offering was that the instructor used course materials from three concurrent MOOCs to help students learn the subject. These three MOOCs included _Visualizing Japan (1850s–1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity_ (edX), _Visualizing Postwar Tokyo_ (University of Tokyo), and _Four Faces of Contemporary Japanese Architecture_ (University of Tokyo).

{{< quote "We said, ‘Why don’t we create a system that’s exactly the opposite of what the rest of the world is doing [in e-learning] and . . . just give [our materials] away so that anyone, anywhere in the world, can take advantage of MIT faculty’s commitment to education.’ That’s how we started with OpenCourseWare." "— Shigeru Miyagawa" >}}
